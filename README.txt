This plugin helps sending SMS messages to customers upon completion of their order or via the 'Edit Order' page in the Wordpress backend.

== Description ==

The plugin integrates with the Twilio API and Woocommerce in order to provide the best user experience possible. A checkbox appears at the
Woocommerce checkout page which gives the customer the ability to choose if they want to be informed about the process of their order via SMS.
Extra options also appear in the 'Edit Order' page which give the shop owners the ability to send customized SMS messages directly to the customer.

It is required to have a valid Twilio account and Woocommerce installed.
More features are coming soon! Stay tuned!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, it is and also open source.

= So that means I can copy it? =

Yes you can. Although attribution to the author does not hurt. So leave commented sections as is.

It's Greek.

= Can I change the language? =

Of course, but you must do it via editing all the files that contain text. No auto way, sorry.
