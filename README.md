# Readnet Twilio (rTwilio)
###### A Wordpress plugin to send SMS messages

## Description
The plugin integrates with the Twilio API and Woocommerce in order to provide the best user experience possible. A checkbox appears at the Woocommerce checkout page which gives the customer the ability to choose if they want to be informed about the process of their order via SMS.
Extra options also appear in the 'Edit Order' page which give the shop owners the ability to send customized SMS messages directly to the customer.

**Requirements:**
- Wordpress (duh!) above version 5.0
- Woocommerce above version 3.5.0
- A valid Twilio account with available credits
